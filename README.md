# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to comb through election data for 3 counties in Colorado and identify the winning candidate for this congressional election as well as provide the amount of votes each candidate received and the amount of votes cast in each county.  By pulling all the information we can also identify which county had the largest county turnout which will help plan for future elections. The Challenge provided us with the code that tallied the candidate data. Therefore, I could focus on the county data.  Using the knowledge I learned through the exercises, I pulled the percentage of and total votes by county and indentified the county with the largest voter turnout.
